# 🖥️ NoRebootHQ

**A Hands On Microservices Project in Go**

NoRebootHQ is a hands-on backend project where you'll build a production-grade system to manage, version, and deploy application configurations in real-time — without restarting services.



This is a starter repo that gives you the foundational project setup and structure you'll use to build the full platform using:

> Go · gRPC · ProtoBuf · PostgreSQL · Redis · Bazel · Docker and more

Ready to go beyond tutorials and build a system that companies actually need?
